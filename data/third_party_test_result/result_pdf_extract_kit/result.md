Aswe were not concerned with weight status,sex,or

trainingstatus comparisonsin this initial study,coupled withthefact that no interactions were noted for any of the above-mentioned comparisons,onlypooleddata are presented in the tables and discussed within this manuscript  

It is important to note that our findings are in refer- encetorelativelyhealthy,youngtomiddleagemenand women (agerange:20-62years),with a wide BMI range  $(18.0~\mathrm{kg}.\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  to  $\bar{40.6~\mathrm{kg}\!\cdot\!\mathrm{m}^{-2}}$  ,and varied regular exercise anddietary habits.Interestingly,we noted similar find- ings inall subject groups(as discussed below).For example,similar percent changes in all measured var i- ablesfrompre to post fast were observed in subjects who are of normal weight and lowbodyfat(e.g,  $<10\%$  formenand  $<20\%$  for women),who exercise regularly for  $^{4+}$  hours per week andeatavery“clean”diet ona regular basis (including vegetarians),as compared to overweight/obese,sedentary subjects whoconsumea relatively poor diet.However,itshouldbenoted that while the percentchange inoutcome measures was similar betweensuch individuals,the absolutevalues werebetter for thenormalweight,exercise enthusiasts compared to theoverweight/obese,sedentary subjects （discussed below).Based on our collective findings,it is possible that individuals with diagnosed metabolic and cardiovascular disordersmay experience clinically mean- ing ful results on such a dietary regimen.Futurework should consider the inclusion ofsuchpatients,as this diet maybe considered an anti-inflammatory，anti atherogenic,anti-hypertensive,non-pharmacologic approachto disease risk management.  

While we did noteareduction ofbloodpressure,as wellasadecrease in total（l9%)and LDLcholesterol  $(23\%)$  with the Daniel Fast in just three weeks,findings similar to those noted for other plant-baseddiets [19-21],we also noted a decreasein HDL-C（14%). While the total:HDL-Cwasimproved slightly（Table4）, the drop in HDL-Cremains a concern.If this eating plan is to be viewed as"heart healthy”in all aspects, future studies involving the Daniel Fast may include specificfood choices(e.g.,almonds,plantagoovata husks,walnuts)[22-24]and/or dietary supplements [25,26]noted toincreaseHDL-C,inaneffort tomain tain HDL-C while decreasing both totaland LDL-C AsidefromHDL-C,althoughinsulin（24%),HOMA-IR (26%),and C-reactiveprotein(49%)decreased during the 21dayfast,these decreases failed to reach statistical significance.Aposthoc power analysis indicated thata total of 57 subjects would be needed to demonstrates ta- ti st ical significance forinsulinand HOMA-IR,while65 subjectswould beneeded forC-reactiveprotein.Future studiesmay includealarger samplesizein order to improve the chance of achieving statistical significance for thesevariables.Ofcourse,inclusion ofindividuals
